  abstract        = { We discuss the relevance of the recent machine learning
                  (ML) literature for economics and econometrics. First we
                  discuss the differences in goals, methods, and settings
                  between the ML literature and the traditional econometrics and
                  statistics literatures. Then we discuss some specific methods
                  from the ML literature that we view as important for empirical
                  researchers in economics. These include supervised learning
                  methods for regression and classification, unsupervised
                  learning methods, and matrix completion methods. Finally, we
                  highlight newly developed methods at the intersection of ML
                  and econometrics that typically perform better than either
                  off-the-shelf ML or more traditional econometric methods when
                  applied to particular classes of problems, including causal
                  inference for average treatment effects, optimal policy
                  estimation, and estimation of the counterfactual effect of
                  price changes in consumer choice models. },

  abstract        = {This paper analyses the impact of economic conditions and
                  access to primary health care on health outcomes in Norway.
                  Total mortality rates, grouped into four causes of death, were
                  used as proxies for health, and the number of general
                  practitioners (GPs) at the municipality level was used as the
                  proxy for access to primary health care. Dynamic panel data
                  models that allow for time persistence in mortality rates,
                  incorporate municipal fixed effects, and treat both the number
                  and types of GPs in a district as endogenous were estimated
                  using municipality data from 1986 to 2001. We reject the
                  significant relationship between mortality and the number of
                  GPs per capita found in most previous studies. However, there
                  is a significant effect of the composition of GPs, where an
                  increase in the number of contracted GPs reduces mortality
                  rates when compared with GPs employed directly by the
                  municipality.},
